error[E0499]: cannot borrow `locks` as mutable more than once at a time

11 |     let _a = locks.lock_mutex().0;
   |              ----- first mutable borrow occurs here
12 |     // Invalid
13 |     let _b = locks.lock_mutex();
   |              ^^^^^ second mutable borrow occurs here
14 | }
   | - first borrow might be used here, when `_a` is dropped and runs the `Drop` code for type `std::sync::MutexGuard`
